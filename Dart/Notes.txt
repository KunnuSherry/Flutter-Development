1. Why Dart? for making apps using flutter
2. Dart uses JIT compiler so that we do not need for the results to see the output
3. But while using program it uses AOT.
4. We will need a SDK for writing the dart code there are 3 ways:
   1. flutter sdk contains it.
   2. dart sdk contains it.
   3. online dart sdk.
5. Dart follows precedence or BODMAS.
6. Variables 
   1. In Dart is used for storing the values, i.e if we want user input.
   2. We would need to change every constant if variables are not used
   3. <datatype><variable name> = value;
7. DataTypes
   1. Includes int, double, String, bool, dynamic
   2. dynamic can take any datatype.
